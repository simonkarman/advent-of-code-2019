# Advent of Code: 2019 - Simon Karman
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. This repository contains [my](https://www.simonkarman.nl/) solutions to puzzles of the 2019 edition. 

For each puzzle day a different programming language is used. Moreover, no additional changes, optimizations or refactorings are applied after the solutions to a puzzle is found. The code of each solution is therefor in the exact same state as when the solution to a puzzle was found.

The solutions can be run by executing the `./run.sh` script in the directory of the puzzle. The run script does not install libraries needed to run the source code, you should install these, such as Java and Node, yourself.
